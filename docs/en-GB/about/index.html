<div class='segmentHeader'>App description</div>
<div class='segmentBodyWrapper'>Learn8 your way ("Learn it your way") is a widely applicable study tool. Study languages, memorise names and faces, practise mental arithmetics, improve your maths skills, rote learn topography or train your short term memory for any random subject.<br/>
<br/>
How does Learn8 work?<br/>
- Create your own learn items - optionally with hints and feedback - or import items that other people have shared with you.<br/>
- Start a (daily) learning session for a set of items by selecting the tags that you do or do not want to study today.<br/>
- Share your items with friends, colleagues or students easily via WhatsApp, Mail or via your website.<br/>
- You can have multiple accounts on one device.<br/>
- You can synchronise your learning progress between multiple devices.<br/>
- Learn8 can be used offline and without subscription.<br/>
<br/>
Technical details:<br/>
- For the display of maths formulas, you can use LaTeX.<br/>
- For generating questions and answers, you can use JavaScript.<br/>
- For mobile devices, you can specify what type of virtual keyboard should be used for answering. For example: you may want to use a numeric keyboard for arithmetics.<br/>
- A virtual maths keyboard can be used on all devices.<br/>
- On Windows, you can select a folder with images and easily create learn items for all those images (for example, for teachers that need to memorise faces).<br/>
- Items that are created on a computer, can also be used on mobile devices and vice versa.</div>

<div class='segmentHeader'>Legal note</div>
<div class='segmentBodyWrapper'>Learn8 your way does not knowingly collect any data about its users, neither for itself nor for third parties. Concrete intentions:<br/>
- If you create an account, your data is stored only on your device - not online.<br/>
- The app will not connect to the internet by default (but if you choose to synchronize via Dropbox for example, a connection to the internet must be made and Dropbox will store your data).<br/>
<br/>
However:<br/>
- Even though Learn8 your way intends to provide safe software, remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and Learn8 your way cannot guarantee its absolute security. Therefore, you should never use Learn8 your way for learning things that contain sensitive data. Learn8 your way cannot be held accountable for any form of data collection, data theft, or any form of damage, etcetera, by any party.<br/>
- Even if you choose to share your learn items via a .learn8 file, the intention of Learn8 your way is to keep you anonymous - Learn8 your way does not knowingly add data to ".learn8 files for sharing" that can be traced back to you (unless you add it yourself or your means of distribution results in traceability). Despite this intention, mistakes can be made or bad design may yield unwanted results. If you choose to use the option to share items, you acknowledge this risk and you will not hold Learn8 your way accountable for it.<br/>
- Although Learn8 your way intends to provide a stable learning environment with complete backwards compatibility, mistakes can be made or bad design may result in unwanted app behaviour or even intended breaking changes. Learn8 your way cannot be held accountable for any form of data loss, unusable data, or damage of any form, etcetera, for any party.</div>
